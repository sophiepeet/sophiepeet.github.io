#This is a project proposal markdown.
#This project will show the energy use of the top 10 most populated countries in the world.
#The data will be ranked from "best" to "worst" for amount of co2 emissions.
#Data will be gathered about what type of energy is used for each country.
#What percentage of each type of energy is being used for each country.
#I will create a csv that has the data for these specific countries stats.
#This data will be joined with a vector layer of each countries shapefile.
#I will display this extra data about specific energy use through popups on a webmap.
#data is collected from worlddata.info
#Raster to vector to change range of co2 values to rank 1-5, good to bad.
