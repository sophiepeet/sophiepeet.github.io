## Snurtle and Box Elder Cat Habitat<br>

### **Project description:** <br>
This project was created using ArcMap model builder.<br>
These species had a set of contraints, such as buffers and forbidden areas <br>
they were able to live in. Using this set of constraints, I was able to create <br>
a comprehensive map of where each spcies could live, and where their <br>
habitats overlapped. <br>
<br>
Tools used:
- Erase
- Union
- Intersect
- Buffer
- Clip
- Merge
- Dissolve
