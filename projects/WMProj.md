### **Project description:** <br>
The project is a webmap created in QGIS, using data gathered from the National Park Service and the US Census Bureau. The data highlights 58 national parks in the United States and using a Google Maps basemap, and a major roads map(not shown) from the Census. I used a buffer around each national aprk shapefile of and arbitrary 30 miles, to show which parks are most accessible from the highway. Out of the 58, 21 of these parks are; within 30 miles of the major road, or adjacent to one of these parks.   <br>
