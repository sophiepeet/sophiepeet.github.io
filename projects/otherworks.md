### **EPA Rainworks Challenge 2019**
---
**This project was completely during a course at University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a focus on Ecohydrolygy. This project was conmpleted with Sarah Carpe and Matt Edgley. Our focus for this project was Landscape architecture. On this design board you will see a section of the UMBC transformed into an effective stormwater management zone, while also effectively showing an aestetically pleasing aspect. This project highlights low impact deisgn and submerged gravel wetlands. This design works with the existing landscape to create a system of terraces to guide rainwater into retention ponds. There is also an option for monitoring equipment and an outdoor classroom.**

### **Food Access During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Baltimore County, Maryland**
---
**This project was completed for a course during Spring 2020, while the COVID-19 pandemic is at its peak. This map highlights food access issues for children in Baltimore County, Maryland. There are 41 free food handout sites around the county but they are not as spread out as one may anticipate. Many sections of the county are left untouched, presumably in places where children are not in greatest need. Although this is a great program and is probably reaching many children who are in severe need of food, there are a set of issues with any program as such. This creates and unequal food lanscape around the city/county and forces children with no other means to travel farther than normal to obtain food, at a higher risk to their health and saftey.**
