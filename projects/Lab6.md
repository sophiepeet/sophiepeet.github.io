## **Project Description** <br>
  These maps show different ways to visualize tweets.. The first is the raw point data, shown in blue are tweets containing "COVID19" amd shown in red are tweets containing "Trump". The tweets were gathered using the 'rtweet' function in R (screenshot of code and download below). I first ran the code for tweets containing "COVID19" and then ran this code again for tweets containing "Trump". The tweets gathered are all geocoded, include a latitude and longitude, and are not retweets, ensuring the tweets are unique. 
  We can see that the hot spots for the tweets are along the coast lines, and the places that have been most affected by the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. Another observation to make with the included layer of each state capital, is that even in states where there is a lower population, and population density, there is still a cluster of tweets around most of the capitals. This could be due to a hub of activity and a higher density of people in these areas. 
  The second map shows these tweets in two more ways.
