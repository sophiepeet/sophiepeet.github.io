<img src="/images/antarctica2.png?raw=true"/>

**Project Description**: 
This is a series of maps created to hihglight the effect of sea levels change in and around<br>
Antarctica due to melting of polar and global ice. Included is an isostatic elevation model. <br>
These maps were created using raster calculator in ArcMap and other spatial statistics tools.<br>
Though the last two maps may look very similar there is more land lost from total global ice<br>
melt and could potentially be detrimental for habitats around Antarctica.

Tools used:
- Raster Calculator
- Spatial Statistics
-
