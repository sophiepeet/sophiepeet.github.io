This is a project description markdown.
This project was created to find out where there is correclation between number of prisons and number of people incarcerated in the United
States. 
## **VECTOR**
For the United States, state layer rendering there was data collected from prisonpolicy.org, on the number of people incarcerated
per state. This data was added to the attribute table, creating a new field, and using this to categorize the data, in a simple cloropleth
map layer.

I retrieved a prison shapefile layer USGS ScienceBase, with all of the prison locations/areas in the United States
