### [Comparison of Tweets Across the United States Containing "'COVID19' or 'Trump'"](/projects/Lab6)<br><br>
[<img src="images/screenshotNY.JPG?raw=true"/>](projects/$$$$$.pdf) <br><br>
**These maps take data gathered form Twitter's API via R, to compare tweets containing the kewyord "COVID19" or "Trump", they are depicted in several different ways. The first map in this series shows the raw data gathered, with each tweet shown as a point on the map. The second map shows two different wasy to visualize the data spatially, they are shown by a density factor and a count per polygon (state) factor.**

### [Number of Prisons and Rates of Incarceration per State in the United States](/Project1/index.md)<br><br>
[<img src="Project1/coverphoto.JPG?raw=true"/>](Project1/IncarcUSA1.pdf) <br><br>
**This map explores prisons in the each state of the United States two ways; rate of incarceration(per 1000 people) and number of prisons in each state. This map was created using vector and raster analysis to have the viewer interpret the data as a comparison between these two factors.**

 ### [Effect of Highway Proximity on Visitors to National Parks](/projects/WMProj)<br>
 
 [<img src="images/WebMapSS.PNG?raw=true"/>](https://sophiepeet.github.io/webmap/qgis2web_2020_02_19-11_29_49_299210/index.html)
 
**This is a webmap created in QGIS using data from the National Park Service (NPS) and the United States Census Bureau, and Google Mpas Basemap. The purpose of this map to see if proximity to a highway affects the amount of people that visit a given national park in a year (visitor data, 2018).**

### [Total Polar Ice Melt, Land Cover Antarctica](projects/project2)<br><br>
[<img src="images/map2_antarctica.png?raw=true"/>](projects/AntarcticaMaps.pdf) <br><br>
**This series of maps explores the possibility of total polar and global ice melt, and shows how each of these conditions would affect Antarcticas land cover. There are also references for current conditions, of general elevation and bedrock elevation. As the climate continues to change melting of permafrost is a key factor to analyze.**

### [Snurtle Habitat Range, Utah, USA](/projects/project1) <br><br>
[<img src="images/map1_ofawesomeness.png?raw=true"/>](projects/Lab6_Part2.pdf) <br><br>
**This map was comprised from an exercise using a model builder in ArcMap. The data and guidelines of habitat and potential habitat intersection were provided regarding these fictional creatures. These same techniques could be employed for a number of different real life scenarios.**
